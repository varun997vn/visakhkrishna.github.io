                <h4> TRAVELOGUE </h4>

                <p>In this travelogue, I cover my journey up to the white north and my experience hunting down the fabled Northern Lights or Aurora Boreolis.</p>

                <!-- images -->
                <figure class="style1">
                  <img src="./assets/post-002-fig-1.jpg" alt="Book cover" style="width:50%">

                </figure>

                <p>Having lived in Stockholm for over 5 years, I was yet to see the fabled Northern lights. It has been quite elusive to me in my previous visits to the North. So five of us decided to embark on a journey above the Arctic circle and hunt it down.</p>

                <h2>The Journey</h2>

                <p> From Stockholm, we had to travel about 1200 km north to maximize our chances of finding Northern lights. In the COVID19 era, it did not feel right to fly out to the nearest airport at Luleå or Kiruna, both situated in Sweden’s largest and the northern-most province- Norrbotten. So we booked a coupe for six in SJ’s overnight train to Boden from Stockholm Central. Normally the train is supposed to proceed towards the northern-most mining town of Kiruna but due to track maintenance work stopped at Boden. Here SJ could do a better job notifying route changes to their passengers in advance! From Boden we booked a car rental to further travel up north. Something I realized here is that a driving license is an absolute necessity. For our stay up in the North, we booked a nice cottage via AirBnB on the banks of the Torne river in Pajala. </p>
                
                <figure class="style1">
                    <img src="./assets/post-002-fig-1.jpg" alt="Book cover" style="width:50%">
                    <figcaption>Book cover</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>As evident from the picture above, Norrbotten is already experiencing winter when 1200 kms south, the trees have just decided to start shedding their leaves. So you need to prepare for a -12 to -15 degrees C when you embark upon this trip. Remember, it is even more important since you will be scouting for the lights out in the cold when it is dark and wont necessarily be staying indoors. We started from Stockholm at 18:00 hrs to reach Boden early morning the next day at 06:00. Then Pajala was a further 3.5 hours drive towards the north.</p>

                <h2>Scouting for the Northern lights</h2>
                <b>Ye northern lights kidhar hai? Peepal ped ke aagey left le lo </b>
                <em>( Transl. Where is this northern lights? Take a left from the banyan tree.)</em>

                <p>Here is the thing about Northern lights. You cant drive up to a local and ask him/her which way to go see Northern lights like you would for the Eiffel tower or the Taj Mahal. At the same time you shouldn't necessarily decide to 'wing' it either. You get to see them with some patience and following weather updates.</p>

                We kept track on the two main aspects on our smart phones:

                <h4>Aurora activity:</h4>
                http://www.aurora-service.eu/

                <h4>Cloud cover:</h4>
                https://www.smhi.se/q/Stockholm/2673730

                <p>Aurora activity is a general measure of the probability and/or the intensity of the appearance of the Northern lights. It goes on a scale between kp 0 to kp 8. Anything above 3 is considered good above the Arctic circle, provided you are out of city limits where there is a lot of light pollution, rendering the Northern lights invisible. The website updates prediction for every 3 hour window, guided by NASA’s satellites. This measure varied between 1 to 5 during our stay in Pajala. kp 5 is considered really intense, so much that it might be visible from southern latitudes as well. See here</p>

                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> all the talk about Aurora is pointless if the cloud spoils the party <span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Coming to the second point, all the talk about Aurora is pointless if the cloud spoils the party which exactly happened in our case for two days. Our cottage stood at the right latitude and the right level of Aurora activity. BUT it got densely clouded in the night. That is where we used the cloud cover prediction website which worked reasonably well and provided us locations on the map within a driving distance of 100–200 kms that had clear skies. And to give credit where it is due: <em>Climate prediction works!</em> </p>

                <h3>Day 1 and a half: You win some, you lose some</h3>
                So we hopped on to our car to drive towards clear skies in the middle of the night to the middle of nowhere. Something I never thought I would be doing. We reached a hill about 150 kms far from our house at about 1 in the morning, guided by the cloud cover map. We got out to admire the clear sky…. and immediately went back into the car. It was freezing -12 degrees out there. But nevertheless we warmed ourselves by turning on the heater in the car every half hour and continued venturing out to just gaze at the stars.

                    <figcaption>To the car: Driving towards clear skies in the middle of the night</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> I had never really seen the sky filled up with so many stars and their clusters.<span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Having lived in cities (some really polluted ones in that), I had never really seen the sky filled up with so many stars and their clusters. It really made me understand why Astrology was such a big thing in the ancient times. I always thought they were ‘over-imagining’ shapes (or tripping) since I hadn't seen so many stars before. But here, for a short (and very cold) duration I too was able to see what the ancient Indians, Greeks and the Egyptians saw. A clear glance at the endless patterns and shapes of stars before me.</p>

                <p>The time it took for me to ponder all the above was enough for my toe nails to start biting from the knee-deep snow I was standing on. So I went inside the car and heated myself up. Coming to the northern lights however, unfortunately this night wasn’t it. We huddled back into our car when the sun rose at 6:00 and went off to sleep in our cottage.</p>

                <p>Here is the funny thing about sun rise in the Arctic. The Sun ‘teases’ you for a long time (about 1 hour probably) staying just behind the horizon, flooding enough light to drown out the darkness but yet maintaining a dusky sky. However, it does kill any possibilities of seeing the Northern lights. The sun officially rose at 07:23. Go figure!</p>

                <p>We did see a beautiful star-filled sky but with no sign of Aurora. We go home now to fight the next night.</p>

                <h2>Mongols FTW</h2>

                <p> One of the good things that I liked about this book is its devotion of time to Mongols, their origins, strategies, governance, social practices and ultimately the fissures amongst the hordes. For a book NOT on Mongols, I really was able to see how they fit in the larger scheme of things w.r.t silk roads. The author has tried to divert our attention from the chilling acts they are usually known for by arguing that it has often been their last resort to beat the submission out of the resisting tribes/kingdoms. Further, he dwells further into their administrative systems and how practical the rulers were w.r.t religion. I really chuckled at the encounter of the Mongol leader with a Christian missionary sent by the Pope. It is one of the aspects of the book that really did justice to the book w.r.t reader expectations. </p>

                <h2>Where are the Ottomans?</h2>

                <p> One of the many important empires that I was looking forward to reading within the context of silk roads was the Ottoman empire. Spanning across three different continents and lasting for more than six centuries, I was eager to read about their contributions to the trading networks and their longevity in general. Sadly, this book abandons Constantinople (Istanbul) after its fall in the 15th century, and only surfaces later when the Ottoman territory is being divided between Britain and France in the 20th century. Similar treatment was meted out to the earlier caliphates in the region as well such as the Abbasids, Ummayads, etc.</p>

                <h2>Shifting the centre to western Europe</h2>

                <p> In the later half of the book, the centre of narrative was shifted entirely to Western Europe and their viewpoints and before long we are sucked into the tired and tested ‘this led to world wars’ routine that accompanies a lot of history books. While this is a completely justified narrative if your book was ‘The influence of Western Europe on silk roads’, it clearly is not justified when you are reading ‘THE Silk roads’. The author tries to justify this shift by arguing that the ‘world’s centre’ kept shifting consistently starting from the cradle of civilization in Levant. For instance, when the Americas and the sea-route to India from Europe were discovered, he argues that the center of the world shifted westwards to Spain and Portugal from the Italian city states such as Venice and Genoa that had so far held virtual monopoly over trade through Levant (and consequently to India and China in the east). At this point of time Britain and Netherlands were the backwaters who were going to dominate on the back of a strong navy and mercantile system respectively in about a couple of centuries — becoming the new centers. I really wondered while reading through this point in the book on what is happening in Persia at this time? Moreover, the center of the world narrative to put mildly is a bit flawed since there were multiple centres of power lining the silk roads, and therefore it is a bit generous to assume that the silk roads’ very point of existence was to lead towards the ‘power centres’ in Venice and Lisbon.</p>

                <p> In addition to these points, some lazy conclusions could have been better avoided such as the Ramayana supposedly being influenced by the Iliad and Odyssey on the account of Alexander reaching the Indus river, or the very farfetched notion that the plunder in South America financed the building of Taj Mahal, etc. While I understand the author’s honest attempt to not be Euro-centric by looking at how critical he is in the last few chapters, assigning all blame for the unfortunate developments in the world to European powers is still Euro-centric. It’s just not so in a positive way.</p>
