                <h4>TRAVELOGUE SERIES</h4>
                <p>I started out with the longest leg of my journey. The 460 km long journey took me close to 10 hours by train and costed me just 140 Rs (< 2$).</p>

                <p>By design, these train routes come with numerous halts for people to hop on and hop off along the way. This one had 32 in between. And the landscape varied heavily as well. You pass by lush fields dotted with tall windmills on the base of the western ghats up till Dindugul. Then the terrain turned drier as you passed by weathered broken mountain ranges of the eastern ghats down till Madurai where river Vaigai flows. Further south till Tirunelveli, vast parts of the land are thorn scrub forests, which receive very little rainfall and also lack any major river.</p>

                <p>The journey also presented a living laboratory to listen to, and observe people from various walks of life. For instance, this was the first time that I heard the southern accent (from Tirunelveli) in its true form. People were generally nice and simple and I had interesting conversations with them. For instance an electrician that boarded at Kovilpatti was telling me about social expectations in his village and the aspirations he had for his family. He advised me to consider finding a job with a government agency since ‘nothing beats the respect you get here when you work for the government’. I gently nodded along to his well-intentioned proposition as he wished me good luck before he got down at Tirunelveli. At Tirunelveli we had an extended halt since the locomotive was replaced here for the final 70 kms ahead.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>The path to Tiruchendur thereon ran parallel to the Thamirabarani river. And one could notice the landscape change too. As far as the eyes could see, Plantains! — acres and acres of broad leaves. I wondered if they actually grew enough bananas here to feed a medium-sized European country. The thorn-filled landscape between Madurai and Tirunelveli had been replaced by nature’s bounty, just because of a river. No wonder rivers are given female names. In a true sense they are mothers — nourishing the land and the creatures living beside them. Otherwise all we would be left with are thorns.</p>


                <h2>Tiruchendur</h2>

                <p>Tiruchendur is a small town. It might not be a stretch to say that the economy of this municipality of about 35k relies heavily on the presence of this major shrine.</p>

                <!-- images -->
                <figure class="style1">

                </figure>

                <p>In early December, while the parts of northern TN were experiencing storms and heavy downpours, there was a soft drizzle filling the atmosphere with mist. The railway station is situated about 2 kms away from the temple (situated at the coast). The entire town seemed to me like a network of concrete structures stretching from the state highway in the west to the temple on the coast in the east. Nearly every building seemed to be lodges and hotels asking you to stay there. In the pursuit of maximizing revenues with tourist footfalls, it looked as if the local administration had allowed relentless mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, etc — surrounding (or even encroaching upon) the main attraction of the town. All these thoughts nevertheless vanished as my sights got hold of the Gopuram (Main tower) of the temple.</p>

                    <img src="./assets/post-004-fig-6.jpg" alt="Book cover" style="width:100%">

                <h2>Abode on shore</h2>
                <p>It was six by the time I reached the temple. I had already checked in a hotel and freshened up on the way. A big vel (divine spear associated with the God) shaped lights adorned the tower of the Gateway (Gopuram). Gopurams are gateways into the temple complex and are usually the tallest structure in the Dravidian style of temple architecture. In fact the very sight of Gopuram itself screams Tamil nadu as visible in their state government’s seal. As I walked in further, I reached the coast and I saw the ocean fading into the sky. The entrance was quite crowded and cackling with life. You had many groups of Ayyappa pilgrims from Andhra sitting around eating, washing hands, chatting, and some also sleeping. There were street dogs lurking around people eating, waiting for them to throw in the leftovers. There were families waiting by the entrance and also old men who appeared to be ascetics. There were also dedicated places to keep your footwear before you go inside.</p>

                <figure class="style1">

                </figure>

                Just beside the temple complex to the south lies the Tiruchendur beach. Despite the rain, it was full of life. Children were running around within the careful line of sight of their parents, vendors going around selling groundnuts, Teenagers running into the ocean, rain didn’t seem to stop them. Of course a good amount of the sand had found its way outside the temple complex as I completed circling the temple compound and queued up to get inside. It looked to be a 1 hour wait before I could enter the sanctum sanctorum. This gave me enough time to wonder, "What is the God associated with mountains (kurinji) doing in an obscure location on the coast?"

                    <h4>#Event at Tiruchendur — Soorasamhaaram</h4>

                    Time for another story. A demon, Soorapadman was terrorising the gods of the time, even imprisoning some of them as his personal slaves. The main diety fought the final war here in Tiruchendur (or in the ocean 2 kms from here) where he achieved absolute victory over Soorapadman (Soora-samhaaram). Therefore this was a key place event in the diety's life. Therefore it is situated on the shore. A key ritual associated with this shrine is therefore the enactment of Soorasamhaaram which happens around October-November drawing huge crowds.(< 2$)

                </blockquote>

                <p>Back in the present, the queue in the temple slowly took me inside the temple complex away from the rain outside. I saw beautiful sculptures of various dieties adorning the pillars. As we entered the main sanctum where the moorthy (main idol) was installed, there was excitement in the devotees as they called out for the decorated lord in front of us. This is one of the moments in life when you are absolutely conscious of your height. Everyone is stretching out to catch a glimpse of the idol in the crowd and 5 cms would make a huge difference given the time you have — with the priests requesting you to move to keep the queue moving. Nevertheless, I did catch a glimpse and was thankful. That's one thing you always do. Catch a glimpse atleast once! For e.g. would you travel to Paris and not look at the Mona Lisa because the queue in the Louvre was long? Take that situation and multiply it by 100.</p>

                <h2>The Dutch connection</h2>
                <p>Like many places in this part of our world, this small town too had not been spared from plunder. I discovered this only when I exited the main sanctum sanctorum on my way to the exit. I was in the outer ring of the temple complex when colourful pictures adorned on the walls caught my attention. Usually they are retellings of the diety's legends (like the one I described above) that catch the fascination of small children. As I went closer to take a look, I realised it was much more serious than that. It was the chronicling of the darkest period of the temple's history. It was written in very small letters in Tamil and you can find the entire story with the illustrations here.</p>

                <p>Nobody really knows exactly when the temple was constructed. The earliest existing inscription dates 875 AD, about 1150 years from today — a century before the Vikings embraced Christianity. It was renovated over the years and expanded by the many dynasties that ruled the parts ever since. Things were going fine, until 1648. Like many European powers of the time, the Dutch East Indies Company had a trading post on the South eastern coast of India about 10 kms north of the temple at Kaayalpatnam.</p>

                <p>A dispute with the local ruler led to the Dutch storming the temple and holding the idol for ransom. This instigated a local rebellion among the locals who fought them fiercely. Meanwhile, the Dutch pressed the panic button and tried to flee with the idol to Sri Lanka and demanded a hefty ransom to return it back. According to the local legend, the Dutch encountered really bad weather in the ocean and dropped the idol in the ocean to ward off bad luck upon which the ocean became calm. Later, a local governor Vadamalaiappa Pillayyan dreamt of the diety giving him specific directions leading to the idol in the ocean — which he retrieved with the help of local fishermen and reinstalled back in the temple.</p>

                <p>In December 2022, I undertook a 8-day journey backpacking across Tamil Nadu in south of India. I describe my travels in a 6-part series of blog posts. I will be blending my travelogue with local folklore, stories, cultural themes and my own personal experience to establish context. I traveled mostly in public transport, ate at local eateries. In this travelogue, I will be sprinkling some of the folklores associated with the particular place I visit so that you can try to visualize the land the way ancient travellers saw them.</p>

                <p>The seed of my journey was sown when I accidentally stumbled upon a rather intriguing story from medieval Tamil Nadu. It was based on the author of <em>Tiruppugazh</em>, a collection of poems glorifying God Murugan (Tiru- Divine Pugazh- Praise). As the son of Shiva, he is worshipped as the God of love and war. He has tremendous following today in Tamil Nadu and all the places where a significant number of Tamils live. In fact, the most auspicious festival associated with him — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaipusam" class="style2">Thaipusam</a> is a national holiday in countries such as Mauritius and Malaysia. The author of this collection of poems was Arunagirinathar, and this was his story:</p>

                <h2>A medieval traveller-philosopher-poet</h2>

                <p>Arunagirinathar was born in a pious family in the temple town of Tiruvannamalai in the 14th century. He was destined for a life of intellect, exhibiting a sharp mind in his childhood vociferously devouring all that was available to read and composing poetry. But the loss of father and the yearnings of youth had other plans for him</p>

                <p>Gradually, he descended into a life of debauchery with a knack for alcohol and womanising. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that the boy once who had such a hold over the classical literature of the day barely could hold a pen anymore. All this happened right before the eyes of his mother and sister who had to keep financing his escapades while praying to mend his ways. It reached a point where this disease-ridden man (wonder why?) had squandered off his family wealth.</p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> He realized his selfishness and his bygone youth, and wondered how irredeemable he had become.<span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The yearning however continued to kick in and one fine day he is furious at his sister for not being able to pay for his trips anymore. In an absolute act of desperation and helplessness, she offers to sell herself so that her brother could get the money to go satiate himself. At this moment something snapped inside him. He realized his selfishness and his bygone youth, and wondered how irredeemable he had become. “Who am I and what have I become?”, he cried while banging his head on the stairs and pillars of the <a class="style2" href="https://www.tamilnadutourism.com/tiruvannamalai/temples/arunachaleswarar-temple-tiruvannamalai.php">ancient temple</a> situated in the middle of the city. The irredeemable man climbed atop the tall temple gate and decided to end his life.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>When he was about to jump to his death, he was saved by God Murugan who cured him of his diseases and convinced him to give life a second chance and write poems and songs which he excelled at. Arunagirinathar spent his remaining life composing rich literature spreading the praises of the lord across the Tamil country and lived up to the ripe old age of 80. His songs reflected contemporary Tamil society and emphasized a devout life of values, which can be heard to this date.</p>

                <h3>Landscapes and their significance in literature</h3>

                <p>Poets of the lore documented their extensive travels and also incorporated the Tamil landscape as devices in his poetry. Just like we read about different types of terrains in our geography text books, tamil literature from the sangam times (3rd century BCE) too had their own classification. The backdrop associated with each terrain was an instrument in the prevailing era's romantic poetry, with each conveying a different emotion. Each type of landscape had a unique character, and a corresponding deity. For instance, kurinji or the mountainous landscape was associated with union between lovers while palai or the desert landscape was associated with separation. Accordingly they are listed below along with the corresponding God from the Vedic pantheon they sought to represent.</p>
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Kurinji (Mountainous) — Seyyon (Murugan)</li>
                    <li>Mullai (Pastoral )— Mayon (Vishnu)</li>
                    <li>Marudam (Plains) — Vendan (Indra)</li>
                    <li>Neithal (Coasts )— Kadalon (Varuna)</li>
                    <li>Palai (Deserts) — Kotravai (Kaali)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> Each type of landscape had a unique character, and a corresponding deity.<span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span></p>
                </blockquote>
            
                Seyyon literally translates to the 'the red one' in tamil and him being the lord of mountains meant that all major shrines dedicated to him were on the top of a hill. This meant a lot of climbing if you were a pilgrim. There is one major exception though as I found out in Tiruchendur.

                <h2>Arunagirinathar's travels</h2>

                <p>Arunagirinathar travelled extensively and the places he visited are listed in the map below, marked by small blue dots. You will find the entire list and descriptions here. Six of the places are however held with high regard as highlighted in this map. These are the six barracks of Lord Murugan or Aarupadaiveedu. They are spread across present day Tamil nadu and each shrine is associated with a significant event in the deity's life as I would discover later. They are marked with the bigger red circles on the map below.</p>

                <h2>My travel route</h2>

                <p>With my inspiration to explore explained in the previous sections, I got down to chart my route. I had seven days in early December since I cannot possibly visit all the places he did, I decided to stitch together a route that combined the six shrines of Aarupadaiveedu and combine it with the poet’s birth place at Tiruvannamalai (larger blue circle in the map above) leaving me with 7 destinations. The six shrines are described in the following order in the literature (see map below)</p>

                #1. Tirupparankundram

                #2. Tiruchendur

                #3. Palani

                #4. Swamimalai

                #5. Tiruttani

                #6. Pazhamudhir sholai

                <p>It wouldnt really make sense to visit in this particular order as you can surmise by looking at the map. There was also the birthplace of the poet I was intending to visit in Tiruvannamalai. I nevertheless covered them all in order #2, #1, #6, #4, Birthplace, #5 and #3. All the places I get to pass by would then be bonuses. I would directly get to the southernmost destination (#2) and slowly make my way around the state to reach my home. It looked something like this:
                </p>

                <h2>Preparation</h2>

                <p>I wanted to travel light, be frugal and keep the trip simple. I just had the map listed above with the seven destinations I needed to cover and a rough idea on how to cover them across the following seven days. I planned to stay in local lodges (without pre-booking), take public transportation, walk as much as possible and eat in wayside restaurants — just how I like to travel. Here are the things I packed for the trip:</p>
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Enough clothes to last a week ( 6x shirts, 4x veshtis, 1 jeans)</li>
                    <li>A blanket in case I need to travel during the night</li>
                    <li>A personal hygiene kit</li>
                    <li>A total of 5000 Rs cash in person and a secret pouch in my bag</li>
                    <li>Aadhar card (Identification document)</li>
                    <li>My phone (+charger) and wallet with some cash for snacks and tea in between                    </li>
                    <li>I had installed Agoda, OYO and Makemytrip apps in my phone in case I wanted to book rooms online</li>
                </ul>
                With the preparation for the trip covered, I slept for a early morning train from Palakkad junction the next day.

                <h2>And it begins..</h2>

                <p>My journey started from my hometown — Palakkad. For the first leg of my journey, I took a train directly to the southernmost checkpoint — Tiruchendur. Luckily for me, there was a passenger train that departed early morning that reached the destination late afternoon. December mornings in the Palakkad pass are beautiful. The morning mist fills the skies and you can almost see the water droplets suspended in the air. The train just arrived at the station and I grabbed my seat.</p>
