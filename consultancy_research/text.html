<p>With increasing role of advanced simulation tools across all engineering domains, industrial standards in railways today even have provisions to use simulations to certify vehicles w.r.t their safety and comfort requirements. In this context, Digital-twin based methods are increasingly gaining prominence in applications such as condition monitoring, derailment prevention, maintenance scheduling, etc. Leveraging these developments, along with researchers at KTH I have been working in Shift2Rail projects to construct a system-wide model to describe how vehicles and track interact with each other and deteriorate over a long period. The approach has been multi-disciplinary encompassing various domains such as vehicle dynamics, contact mechanics, track maintenance strategies, econometrics, etc. Constructing a digital twin of the vehicle-track system can help plan maintenance, enhance safety and further improve the underlying sub-systems.</p>
